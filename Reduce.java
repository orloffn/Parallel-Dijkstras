/**
 * Reduce class based loosely on Fig. 5.4 in Snyder/Lin Principles of Parallel
 * Programming.
 * <p>
 * This does a Schwartz-like reduction. It does as much as possible in a tight
 * loop within each thread before joining the results in the inter-thread tree
 * cap. The tree cap itself is implemented in a single-level array corresponding
 * to its lowest level (just above the tight-loop work of each thread). Then the
 * combining at each level abandons every other active array element from the
 * level below. Since we are moving up from the leaves to the root, the previous
 * levels can be abandoned once the values are read and incorporated in the
 * level above. Eventually, only the root, nodeVal[0] is active and it contains
 * the global reduction value. See Figure 5.1 for a visual.
